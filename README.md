# Neurodiversity In Tech Website

## Helping

### Who is allowed to help?

Anyone can help! You don't need open-source experience, and you don't need to be neurodivergent to help the cause.

### What's the process?

1. **Clone:** Clone the project locally. Don't make a fork.
2. **Ticket:** Choose a ticket from the "To Do" column of [our issue board](https://github.com/orgs/nditcommunity/projects/1) that you think you can complete in under a week.
3. **Assign:** Set to yourself.
4. **Move ticket:** Drag ticket to the "In Progress" column.
5. **Create branch:** Name the local branch with the issue number plus 1-3 words summarizing of ticket, such as `6-favicon` or `18-day-night-toggle`.
6. **Start:** Try your best to get it started.
7. **Pull request:** Create a PR into `main`. It doesn't need to be complete yet; you can create one as soon as you start working on the ticket & keep pushing onto it.
8. **PR template:** Fill in auto-generated template that will pop up. If it's still in progress, just note such in the description, and ignore everything below the "Type of change" section.
9. **Request review:** When it's ready for code review or you have a question, assign it to an [owner](https://github.com/nditcommunity/ndit-website), with any questions right in the PR's "Conversation" tab.
10. **Receive review:** Owners will do a review of code or questions.
11. **Merging:** When it's good to go, an owner will merge the ticket into `main`.
12. **Thank you!** We appreciate you contributing as a volunteer to this open-source, social-good project.

### Who is allowed to move tickets to "To Do"?

Anyone can move a ticket from "To Do" > "In Progress" > "Code Review" as they work, but we currently only allow only owners to move specifically from "Planning" > "To Do".

### Who is allowed to review PRs?

Anyone can help with PR code reviews, but please don't merge into `main`.

### Who is allowed to push to or merge into `main`?

Right now, we only allow only owners to merge PRs into `main`.

## Tech & resources

### What tech is used?

This site is currently made with JavaScript, HTML, & CSS.

### Where are the tickets?

We use GitHub Project Issues ([linked here](https://github.com/orgs/nditcommunity/projects/1)).

### Where is the wireframe?

We have in-progress wireframe brainstorming happening on [Penpot](design.penpot.app). If you'd like an invite to our team there, please reach out.

## Team

### Who are the owners?

The owners of the repo are [@hayleyw7](https://github.com/hayleyw7), [@royemosby](https://github.com/royemosby), & [@jmkoni](https://github.com/jmkoni).

### Is there a code of conduct?

Our general [code of conduct](https://github.com/nditcommunity/ndit-code-of-conduct) applies here.

### Where do meet, ask for help, or chat with the team?

We try to keep specific discourse in tickets and PRs. We also plan & brainstorm more generally in the [#community-website](https://nd-in-tech.slack.com/archives/C06TM05PNNR) channel in the Neurodiversity In Tech Slack Workspace ([join here](nd-in-tech.org)).

### Can I refer friends or colleagues?

Yes, please. We're open to all minds & labor offered.

## Open-Source Software (OSS)

### Does this count as open-source experience?

Absolutely! Once you've had a PR merged into `main`, it's great open-source & volunteer experience to put on your resume and post about on your LinkedIn.

### What's the official licensing?

The website is open-source and licensed under an [MIT License](https://github.com/nditcommunity/ndit-website?tab=MIT-1-ov-file#readme).
