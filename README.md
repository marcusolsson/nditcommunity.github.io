# Neurodiversity In Tech Website

## Permissions

### Who is allowed to help?

Anyone can pick up tickets, try their best, and put in a PR. You don't need open-source experience, and you don't need to be neurodivergent.

### Who is allowed to review PRs?

Anyone can help with PR code reviews.

### Who is allowed to merge into `main`?

Right now, we only allow only owners to merge PRs into `main`.

## Tech & resources

This site is currently made with JavaScript, HTML, & CSS.

### Where are the tickets?

We use GitHub Project Issues: [ticket board here](https://github.com/orgs/nditcommunity/projects/1).

### Where is the wireframe?

We have in-progress wireframe brainstorming happening on [Penpot](design.penpot.app). If you'd like an invite to our team there, please reach out.

### Is there a code of conduct?

Our general [code of conduct](https://github.com/nditcommunity/ndit-code-of-conduct) applies here.

### Where do meet, ask for help, or chat with the team?

We try to keep specific discourse in tickets and PRs. We also plan & brainstorm more generally in the [#community-website](https://nd-in-tech.slack.com/archives/C06TM05PNNR) channel in the Neurodiversity In Tech Slack Workspace ([join here](nd-in-tech.org)).

### Can I ask others to help?

Yes, please. We're open to all of the help that we can get.

## Open-Source Software (OSS)

### Does this count as open-source experience?

Absolutely! Once you've had a PR merged into `main`, it's great open-source & volunteer experience to put on your resume and post about on your LinkedIn.

### What's the official licensing?
