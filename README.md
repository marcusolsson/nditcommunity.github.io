# Neurodiversity In Tech Website

## Permissions

### Who is allowed to help?

Anyone can help! You don't need open-source experience, and you don't need to be neurodivergent to help the cause.

1. Clone the project locally. Don't make a fork.
2. Choose a ticket from the "To Do" column of [our issue board](https://github.com/orgs/nditcommunity/projects/1) that you think you can complete in under a week.
3. Assign it to yourself.
4. Move to the "In Progress" column.
5. Create a local branch with issue number plus 1-3 words summarizing of ticket, such as `6-favicon` or `18-day-night-toggle`.
6. Try your best to get it started.
7. Create a Pull Request (PR) into `main`. It doesn't need to be complete yet; you can create one as soon as you start working on the ticket & keep pushing onto it.
8. Fill in the automated PR template that will pop up. If it's still in progress, just note that in the description, and ignore everything below the "Type of change" section.
9. When it's ready for code review or you have a question, assign it to an [owner](https://github.com/nditcommunity/ndit-website) with any questions right in the PR's "Conversation" tab.
10. Owners and other contributors will check it out when you'd like us to do so.
11. When it's good to go, owners will merge the ticket into `main`.
12. Thank you for contributing as a volunteer to this open-source, social-good project!

## Who is allowed to move tickets to "To Do"?

Anyone can move a ticket from "To Do" > "In Progress" > "Code Review" as they work, but we currently only allow only owners to move specifically from "Planning" > "To Do".

### Who is allowed to review PRs?

Anyone can help with PR code reviews, but please don't merge into `main`.

### Who is allowed to push to or merge into `main`?

Right now, we only allow only owners to merge PRs into `main`.
